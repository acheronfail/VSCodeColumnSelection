# VSCodeColumnSelection

Adds a column selection command to Sublime Text similar to VSCode's <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>click</kbd>.

### Installation

##### Automatic

Soon: Via Package Control.

##### Manual

Clone this repository into your Sublime Text's Packages directory. Easy.

```sh
cd /path/to/Sublime Text/Packages
git clone https://github.com/acheronfail/VSCodeColumnSelection.git
```

### Usage

This package aims to add the VSCcode-like column selection commands to Sublime Text. While it aims to mimic as close as possible the behaviour of VSCode, there is a slight limitation (see L13-24). Other than that, it works a treat!

Place one cursors anywhere, and then <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>click</kbd> where you want the bottom right of the column selection to end. Best explained with a gif:
